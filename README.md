# Seaborn Learning üìä

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate basic to intermediate concepts of **Seaborn**, a powerful Python library for statistical data visualization.
 
## üìñ About Seaborn
Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics with ease, and integrates well with Pandas data structures.

## ‚ú® Key Features:
- Beautiful default styles and color palettes.
- Supports a wide variety of plots: line plots, histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, violin plots, heatmaps, pair plots, and more.
- Simplifies complex visualizations with minimal code.
- Enables easy customization and integration with Matplotlib.

## üìö What's Inside?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `01_LinePlot.py`
- Demonstrates basic line plots.
- Utilizes built-in sample datasets.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `02_Histogram.py`
- Creates histograms and distribution plots.
- Customizations include KDE, rug plots, and color settings.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `03_BarChart.py`
- Visualizes categorical data with bar charts.
- Compares averages across categories using hue for additional dimensions.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ `04_ScatterPlot.py`
- Generates scatter plots with customization for hue, style, size, and transparency.
- Illustrates relationships between numerical variables.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ `05_BoxPlot.py`
- Shows distribution and outliers with box plots.
- Splits data by categorical variables for comparative analysis.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ `06_ViolinPlot.py`
- Displays detailed data distributions using violin plots.
- Incorporates split violins and quartile indicators.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ `07_Heatmap.py`
- Creates heatmaps to visualize correlation matrices.
- Uses annotations and custom color maps for clarity.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ `08_PairPlot.py`
- Provides pairwise relationships between variables with pair plots.
- Offers options for coloring by category and adjusting marker styles.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ `09_SubPlot.py`
- Combines multiple plots into a single figure using subplots.
- Demonstrates layout adjustments with Matplotlib's `plt.tight_layout()`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prasadlonare35/Seaborn.git
   cd Seaborn
2. Run any of the Python scripts:
    ```bash
    python 01_LinePlot.py
    python 02_Histogram.py
    # ...and so on for the other scripts

## üéØ Purpose
These scripts are part of my learning journey to master Seaborn for creating beautiful and informative data visualizations.

Feel free to use or extend them for your own learning! üöÄ
